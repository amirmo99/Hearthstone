# Hearthstone Single Player
This game is the result of a project which was accomplished during the course Advanced Programming. I used Gradle building tool and Intellij Community Edition software to write this game. 
It is based on a similar game named Hearthstone which is available on Google Play and App Store. 

In order to play you must:
1. Clone this folder
2. Have Intellij or Eclipse installed. Also you need gradle.
3. Run src/main/java/admin/HeartStoneGUI.java
4. Enjoy playing :)
